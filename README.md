# Getting Started
This project consists of C++ code files, located in `src/`, that are optimized
for deep learning on the the Arduino microcontroller. Each of these files
can be compiled into an executable with the same name. Use CMake to build these
executables. This set of commands should build all the executables. After
running these commands, these executables should be located in the `build`
directory.
```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
